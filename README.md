## Project Description
This project is a web popular movies catalogue. In here You can move trought most popular movies in the day, search for any specific favorite and see the information about them! 

For this project I used the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/"> The Movie Database API </a> to get all information I needed, integrated with technology of Vue.JS CLI, used the CSS's framework Vuetify and Boostrap and applied all of the steps made with Git on Github.

## Project setup
### First step to have this code on your local system:

- Ensure [Node.js  >=5.10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are installed on your system

1. Install this code on your local system
    
    1. Fork this repository (click 'Fork' button in top right corner)
    2. Clone the forked repository on your local file system
    
        ```
        cd /path/to/install/location
        
        git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/movie.git
        ```  
   
2. Change into directory

    ```
    cd movie
    ```
    
3. Install dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file by copying the sample

    ```
    cp .env_sample .env
    ```
    
    Edit the .env file and replace any variables if needed
    
5. Start project

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

Your site will be available at *localhost:[PORT]* where `PORT` is whatever value is set in your `.env` file.
